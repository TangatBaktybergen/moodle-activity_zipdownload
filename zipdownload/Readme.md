# ZIP Download Activity Plugin for Moodle

This Moodle activity plugin allows teachers to upload a ZIP template containing `.c` files. When a student opens the activity, a personalized ZIP file is generated and downloaded. The plugin automatically replaces specific placeholders in `.c` files with the student's personal information.

##  What It Does
- Teacher uploads a ZIP template when creating the activity.
- ZIP may contain one or more `.c` source files and a `Makefile`.
- The plugin searches each `.c` file and replaces:
  - `@author TODO` â†’ `@ Firstname Lastname`
  - `"00000"` â†’ `"StudentID"` (from Moodle ID number or user ID)
- It also edits the `Makefile` to update the `PORT` value depending on student selection.

##  Platform Selection
When the student clicks the activity:
- They are prompted to select their platform:
  - **Lab** â†’ `PORT=/dev/ttyUSB_MySmartUSB`
  - **Win** â†’ `PORT=COM3`
  - **Mac** â†’ `PORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`
- The plugin edits the `PORT=` line in the `Makefile` accordingly.
- The generated ZIP is renamed to:
  - `Templates-12345-Lab.zip`
  - `Templates-12345-Win.zip`
  - `Templates-12345-Mac.zip`

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

##  Creating the Activity
